# Arithmetic Addition Classification
This repository contains the code (in PyTorch) for "[Arithmetic addition by deep image classification networks: experiments to quantify autonomous reasoning ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04518)" paper by [Shuaicheng Liu](http://www.liushuaicheng.org/), Zehao Zhang, Kai Song, and Bing Zeng.
## Introduction
In this work, we design a series of experiments, inspired by childrenâ€™s learning of arithmetic additions of two integers, to showcase that such networks can go beyond the structural features to learn deeper knowledge.

## Requirements
- [Python3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyTorch(1.2.0+)](http://pytorch.org)
- torchvision 0.2.0+
- numpy
## Train & Evaluation
1. Use the following command to generate the formula images first.
```
python makeimg.py
```
2. Run the following code to train se_resnet and observe the classification results directly.
```
python train.py
```
3. Results above corresponds to the first experiments validating commutative law by default, you can modify train_val_txt.py to conduct other experiments.
